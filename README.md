# On-Demand-Traffic-Control
This repository hosts the code for an On-Demand Traffic Light Control System implemented in C on the ATmega32 microcontroller. This embedded project simulates a real-world traffic light system with enhanced crosswalk support, allowing pedestrians to request a walk signal using a button, dynamically adjusting the signal to accommodate safe crossing.

# Key Features:
  Realistic Traffic Light Simulation: Implements a standard 3-signal (Red, Yellow, Green) traffic light configuration.
  Crosswalk Button: Pedestrians can request a cross signal by pressing a button, which adjusts the signal sequence to allow sufficient crossing time.
  Configurable Timing and Sequence: Easily adjust light durations for different intersections and pedestrian densities.
  
# Technical Details
   Microcontroller: ATmega32, with efficient use of I/O pins and interrupts for real-time responses. Language: C, utilizing precise timing and control for signal switching and crosswalk requests.
