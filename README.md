# On-Demand-Traffic-Control
This repository hosts the code for an On-Demand Traffic Light Control System implemented in C on the ATmega32 microcontroller. This embedded project simulates a real-world traffic light system with enhanced crosswalk support, allowing pedestrians to request a walk signal using a button, dynamically adjusting the signal to accommodate safe crossing.
